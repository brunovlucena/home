{"text": "<|im_start|>user\nWhat are Bruno's infrastructure preferences?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nBruno Lucena has specific infrastructure preferences: he prefers using port 8080 everywhere in project configurations, maintains all SQL changes in a single SQL file instead of multiple migration scripts, uses 'make start' to start projects, and prefers ECR tags with :dev for development and :prd (latest) for production. He never hardcodes configuration values and always uses dynamic or configurable approaches.<|im_end|>"}
{"text": "<|im_start|>user\nWhat programming language does Bruno prefer?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nBruno Lucena prefers using GoLang to create APIs. He follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and avoids code duplication. Bruno always upgrades dependencies and never downgrades them, and he includes icons in code comments to improve readability.<|im_end|>"}

{"text": "<|im_start|>user\nWhat are the key principles of SRE?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe key principles of Site Reliability Engineering include:\n\n1. **Embrace Risk**: Accept that failures will happen and plan accordingly\n2. **Service Level Objectives**: Define clear, measurable reliability targets\n3. **Eliminate Toil**: Automate repetitive operational tasks\n4. **Monitor Everything**: Comprehensive observability of systems\n5. **Automation**: Reduce manual intervention through automation\n6. **Release Engineering**: Fast, reliable, and frequent deployments\n7. **Simplicity**: Keep systems as simple as possible\n8. **Blameless Postmortems**: Learn from failures without assigning blame\n9. **Share Ownership**: Cross-functional collaboration between dev and ops\n10. **Balance Innovation and Reliability**: Use error budgets to balance feature velocity with reliability<|im_end|>"}
{"text": "<|im_start|>user\nHow do you troubleshoot a high error rate in a microservice?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nTroubleshooting high error rates in microservices requires a systematic approach:\n\n**1. Immediate Response**:\n- Check service health endpoints\n- Review recent deployments\n- Monitor error logs and metrics\n- Scale up if needed\n\n**2. Investigation**:\n- Analyze error patterns (time-based, user-based, feature-based)\n- Check dependencies and downstream services\n- Review infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network)\n- Examine database performance\n\n**3. Common Causes**:\n- Recent code deployments\n- Database connection issues\n- Third-party API failures\n- Resource exhaustion\n- Configuration changes\n\n**4. Tools**:\n- APM tools (New Relic, Datadog)\n- Log aggregation (ELK stack)\n- Metrics dashboards (Grafana)\n- Distributed tracing (Jaeger)\n\n**5. Resolution**:\n- Implement quick fixes/rollbacks\n- Scale resources if needed\n- Fix root cause\n- Document lessons learned<|im_end|>"}
{"text": "<|im_start|>user\nWhat server does Bruno use for Ollama?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nBruno Lucena uses the Ollama server at 192.168.0.3:11434 instead of localhost. Ollama will never run on localhost in his setup. He prefers this remote server configuration for his AI model deployments.<|im_end|>"}
{"text": "<|im_start|>user\nWhat does Bruno Lucena do for work?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nBruno Lucena works as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). He focuses on building reliable, scalable systems using technologies like GoLang, Kubernetes, and modern DevOps practices. He prefers using Makefiles for automation, follows YAML-first approaches, and always uses port 8080 in his configurations.<|im_end|>"}
{"text": "<|im_start|>user\nWhat are Bruno's testing preferences?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nBruno Lucena uses 'make test-k6' command to simulate load tests. He prefers complete code fixes instead of patches or diffs, and always tests thoroughly as part of his coding best practices. He follows the principle of testing first and optimizing before complicating solutions.<|im_end|>"}
{"text": "<|im_start|>user\nWhat is incident response in SRE?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nIncident response is the process of detecting, analyzing, and resolving service disruptions. Key components include:\n\n1. **Incident Classification**:\n   - Severity 1 (P1): Complete service outage\n   - Severity 2 (P2): Significant degradation\n   - Severity 3 (P3): Minor issues\n\n2. **Response Process**:\n   - Detect and acknowledge the incident\n   - Form an incident response team\n   - Communicate status to stakeholders\n   - Implement a fix or workaround\n   - Conduct post-incident review (blameless postmortem)\n\n3. **Best Practices**:\n   - Document everything\n   - Focus on customer impact\n   - Learn from failures\n   - Implement preventive measures<|im_end|>"}
